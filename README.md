go-ean
======

go-ean is a simple utility library for calculating EAN checksums and validating EAN-8, EAN-13 and UPC numbers.

## Installation

    go get github.com/nondejus/go-ean/ean

## Usage

To calculate a checksum use the `ChecksumEan8`, `ChecksumEan13` or `ChecksumUpc` functions:

    package main

    import "github.com/nondejus/go-ean/ean"

    func main() {
      c, err := ean.ChecksumUpc("012345678905")
      println(c)  // Prints 5

      c, err := ean.ChecksumEan13("629104150021")
      println(c)  // Prints 3

      c2, err2 := ean.ChecksumEan8("7351353")
      println(c2) // Prints 7
    }

To check the validity of a string as EAN-8, EAN-13 or UPC use `Valid`:

    println(ean.Valid("96385074")) // Prints true
    println(ean.Valid("abc"))      // Prints false
